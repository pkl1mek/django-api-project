## 💡 Project Purpose: Client-Ready Prototype

This project was developed as a specialized training exercise to prepare for a real-world client commission. The primary goal was to architect and test a **Content Management System (CMS)** that empowers a non-technical client to manage their professional portfolio independently.

Instead of hard-coding the projects, I built a system where the client can:
* **Securely log in** to a private administrative area.
* **Upload new realizations** with titles, descriptions, and multiple images.
* **Manage content** by deleting outdated or completed projects in real-time.

By building this prototype, I have established a proven workflow for handling secure authentication, cloud-based media storage, and dynamic data rendering, ensuring that the upcoming client solution will be both stable and user-friendly.
